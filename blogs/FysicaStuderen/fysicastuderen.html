    <p>This is a page which has as a purpose to give a general overview of how to go about studying physics on your own (e.g which courses,resources), I recommend going in the order presented below.</p>

    <p>This site is still under construction</p>

    <h1>Year 1</h1>
    <p>This year you're mostly going to learn a bunch of math, this might not
    feel like the thing you came for but there isn't any physics without math.</p>
    <h2>Analysis 1</h2>
</div>

    <h1>Year 2</h1>
    <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
    I recommend reading the book "Quantum Mechanics" by Bransden and Joachain.

    <h1>Year 4</h1>
    <h2>Early Universe Cosmology</h2>
    I recommend reading the book "Modern Cosmology" by Dodelson and after that maybe take a look at my notes on the <a href="resources/CMB.pdf">CMB anisotropies</a> and 
<a href="resources/QC.pdf">Quantum Cosmology</a>.

    <h1>Year 5</h1>
    <h2>Computational Material Physics</h2>
    <p>My professor on this subject did the great initiative to make <a href="http://beta.compmatphys.org/">an online course</a></p> where you learn to work with the Quantum ESPRESSO software.
