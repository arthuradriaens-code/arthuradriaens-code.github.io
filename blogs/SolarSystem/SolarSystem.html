		We'll first start out by actually building planets, the plan is to be able to create a sphere and (ideally) map a real world photo of the planet on the sphere. 
		To have good control over the amount of gridlines on the sphere we won't use a conventional sphere as shown to the right of this text as it has more detail 
		towards the poles than in the middle. To get a sphere with equally spaced gridlines we'll inflate a cube as shown below.

	<h3>Scripts</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
	Now that we know what to do, we'll start actually doing. First we'll create 2 C# scripts in unity: 
	<ul><li>Planet.cs</li></ul>
	<ul><li>TerrainFace.cs</li></ul>
	The idea is that the planet script will be responsible for creating 6 terrain faces (cube) telling each of them which direction they're facing 
	and each terrainface will then construct their own mesh. We'll start by writing TerrainFace.cs, in the end it'll look 
	like <a href="https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Planets/blob/master/Procedural%20Planet%20E01/Assets/TerrainFace.cs">this</a>
	but that's really intimidating so download the file and we'll go over the lines step by step.
